None

Goals:
I want to build an application that will allow students at Duke to create and find a study group. Students will be able to create an account and create groups to study for specific classes by inputting study location, time, date, study group size limit, and class. The posted study group would have all this information unless it is “private”, then you would be able to invite your friends to join that group and only invited friends would be able to join (or I could implement a password based entry). After posting a study group, other students would be able to join that study group (if group isn’t private). Depending on time limitations, I could even implement a chat-box feature for study groups that a student has joined to further communication between the group on the web app. Users trying to find a study group can filter through the posted study groups by date, class, time, or size. 
I feel like a platform where students can form study groups is something Duke needs and definitely something I would benefit from as I prefer studying in groups. The school relevance is there by implementing such a practical application.
