ReactJS app that will allow students at Duke University to create and find a study group. 

Students will be able to create an account and create groups to study for specific classes by inputting study location, time, date, study group size limit, and class. "Private" study groups will only be accessible by users who are logged in (not guests). After posting a study group, other students would be able to join that study group. 

I feel like a platform where students can form study groups is something Duke needs and definitely something I would benefit from as I prefer studying in groups. The school relevance is there by implementing such a practical application. 

Over time I will add features like a chat-box feature for study groups that a student has joined to further communication between the group on the web app, filtering through the posted study groups by date/class/time/size, user course preferences etc.
